## Usage

### Dynamic Routes

The application supports dynamic routes for displaying vehicle models based on the make and year. The route pattern is:

/result/[makeId]/[year]
[makeId]: The unique identifier for the vehicle make.
[year]: The year of the vehicle model.
The app will fetch and display the models corresponding to the selected make and year.

### Static Paths

The generateStaticParams function is used to pre-render paths for all makes and years dynamically, allowing the application to statically generate pages for each combination of make and year.

### Light and Dark Theme

The application supports both light and dark themes. Tailwind CSS is configured to handle theme switching based on user preferences.
